**Deprecation notice**

As of July 2024, this repository is archived as the parts of this project in production use have moved elsewhere.

If you're looking for the tool which logs user searches to our "reporting" Elasticsearch cluster, see:

The reporting cluster helps us understand, analyse, and report on how wellcomecollection.org is used.
